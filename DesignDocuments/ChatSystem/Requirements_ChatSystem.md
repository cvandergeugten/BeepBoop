# In-Game Text Chat System Requirements Document

## 1. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose**: Outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the text chat system in the robot game.
   - **Scope**: In-game text communication feature that allows players to send and receive messages.
   - **Definitions**: Key terms related to chat system (e.g., "Message", "Chatbox", "Player", etc.).
   - **Stakeholders**: Game developers, players, testers, network administrators.

## 2. **System Overview**
   - **System Description**: A brief overview of the chat system within the game.
   - **Assumptions**: Assumptions about the game environment, network, and users.
   - **Dependencies**: Unreal Engine, Multiplayer Framework, Server Communication, User Interface (UI).

## 3. **Functional Requirements**
   ### 3.1 **Core Functionality**
   - **Text Message Sending**: Players can send messages to other players in the same session.
   - **Text Message Receiving**: Players receive messages sent by others in real-time.
   - **Chat Channels**: Different types of chat (Global, Team, Private).
   - **Message Formatting**: Support for text formatting (colors, emojis, etc.).
   - **Chat Filtering**: Filtering inappropriate language or spam detection.

   ### 3.2 **User Interface**
   - **Chatbox**: Design of the in-game chatbox interface (size, position, opacity).
   - **Message Notifications**: How new messages are displayed (pop-ups, notifications).
   - **User Input**: Method for entering and sending messages (keyboard, game controller).
   
   ### 3.3 **User Management**
   - **Mute/Block Players**: Ability for users to mute/block other players.
   - **Player Tagging**: Allow tagging other players in messages (e.g., @PlayerName).

   ### 3.4 **Performance Requirements**
   - **Real-time Messaging**: Messages must be sent/received with minimal latency (<1 second).
   - **Scalability**: System must support up to X players without noticeable performance degradation.

## 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - **Usability**: Easy to use interface, no more than two clicks to send a message.
   - **Reliability**: High uptime (99.9% availability).
   - **Security**: Encrypted communication to protect chat data.
   - **Localization**: Support for multiple languages.
   - **Accessibility**: Chat features must be accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen readers).

## 5. **System Architecture**
   - **Client-Server Model**: Explanation of how messages are transmitted from client to server and distributed to other players.
   - **Data Flow Diagram**: Visual representation of message flow.
   - **Error Handling**: Plan for message failure scenarios and retries.

## 6. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual components (e.g., sending, receiving, chat filtering).
   - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of message flow in a multiplayer session.
   - **Performance Tests**: Load testing under high player counts.

## 7. **Risks and Mitigations**
   - **Latency Issues**: Risk of high latency in certain network conditions.
   - **Spam/Abuse**: Plan for filtering or blocking disruptive behavior.
   - **Scalability**: Risks of system performance decreasing with a large number of players.

## 8. **Glossary**
   - Definitions of any specific terms used throughout the document.
